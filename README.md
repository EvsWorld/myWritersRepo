My Writers is an open source project dedicated to giving news consumers greater awareness to their trusted journalists. Many experts in journalism agree that in todays 'post truth' environment of fake news, the best way to find reliable news is to find specific trustworthy journalists—and read them exclusively. This is a more reliable method than simply trusting the reputations of a news company.
